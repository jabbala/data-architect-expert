# Udacity Data Architect Expert
In this program, you’ll plan, design and implement enterprise data infrastructure solutions and create the blueprints for an organization’s data management system. You’ll create a relational database with PostGreSQL, design an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) data model to build a cloud based data warehouse, and design scalable data lake architecture that meets the needs of Big Data. Finally, you’ll learn how to apply the principles of data governance to an organization’s data management system.

Learning Objectives:
• Build conceptual, logical, and physical entity relationship diagrams (ERDs).
• Architect a physical database in PostGreSQL.
• Transform data from transactional systems into an operational data store.
• Create a data warehouse system using dimensional data models.
• Use appropriate storage and processing frameworks to manage big data.
• Design end-to-end batch and stream processing architecture.
• Establish data governance best practices including metadata management, master data management, and data quality management.

## Course 1 -  Data Architecture Foundations

### Designing an HR Database
In this project, learners will design, build, and populate a database for the human resources (HR)
department at the imaginary Tech ABC Corp, a video game company. This project will start with a request
from the HR manager. From there, learners will need to design a database using the foundational principles
of data architecture that is best suited to the department’s needs. They will go through the steps of
database architecture, creating database proposals, database entity relationship diagrams, and finally
creating the database itself. This project is a scaled-down simulation of the kind of real-world assignments
data architects work on every day.
